checkSequence(List<String> sequence): checks if the finite automata accepts the sequence by going from state to state for
each letter in the sequence.

checkSequence(String sequence): splits the sequence into characters and calls the checkSequence(List<String> sequence) method.

letter = a|b|..|z|A|B..|Z
