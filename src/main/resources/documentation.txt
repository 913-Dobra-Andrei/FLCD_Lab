For the symbol table I implemented a HashTable ADT that will be used for identifiers and constants.
The hash method will compute the hash value for a specific key.
The add method will add a new key to the hash table, if it doesn't exist, and return the position of the key in the ST,
otherwise it will throw an exception.
The getPosition will return the position of a key in the table.
The getFromPosition method will retrieve the key from a specific position, or will throw an error if the position is invalid.
The containsKey method will return true if a specific key can be found in the table, or false otherwise.
