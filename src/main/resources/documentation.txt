For the symbol table I implemented a HashTable ADT that will be used for identifiers and constants.
The hash method will compute the hash value for a specific key.
The add method will add a new key to the hash table, if it doesn't exist, and return the position of the key in the ST,
otherwise it will throw an exception.
The getPosition will return the position of a key in the table.
The getFromPosition method will retrieve the key from a specific position, or will throw an error if the position is invalid.
The containsKey method will return true if a specific key can be found in the table, or false otherwise.


The scanner has a while that will loop until the current index reaches the end of the program code. At each step it will
skip the comments and white spaces then it will try to treat the following substring as a token, identifier, number constant
or string constant. When the scanner finds any of these, it will add them to the pif and also in the symbol table, if it
is the case (for identifier and constants).
